                <p>In today's fast-paced world, it is essential to take some time off from our<br> busy lives and spend
                    quality time with our loved ones. Engaging in outdoor<br> activities is a great way to bond with
                    family
                    and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some activities that I enjoy doing with my family are biking and camping.
                    <br>Biking is not only a fun activity, but it is also a great way to stay active and<br> healthy. It
                    allows
                    us to explore new places and get some fresh air while we<br> are at it.
                    <br>Camping, on the other hand, is an excellent way to disconnect from the stresses <br>of everyday
                    life
                    and
                    connect with nature. It allows us to appreciate the simple<br> things in life and teaches us to be
                    self-sufficient.

                <p>In today's digital age, watching videos on YouTube has become a popular<br> pastime for people all
                    around
                    the world.
                    One of the primary reasons why <br>people love watching videos on YouTube is its accessibility. With
                    just a few<br> clicks, you can access an endless supply of content from anywhere in the world.
                    <br>Usually, I watch online videos on YouTube 4~5 hours a day. <br>One of my favorite types of
                    videos is
                    traveling. I really enjoy the traveling video because I can learn more about the world around
                    us,
                    such as cultures, <br>history, architecture, and so on.

<!-- I love to spend my leisure time watching online videos and doing some activities outdoors.
<br>During the winter vacation, I discovered a passion for web development and began learning HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript by watching tutorial videos on YouTube.
<br>I will continue to discover new ways to apply my skills in the future. -->
