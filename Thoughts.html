                <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to my website! My name is Yong-Cheng Huang, and I am excited to share my passions and
                    experiences with you. <br>My website is a reflection of my personal and college experiences, and I
                    hope that it gives you a glimpse into who I am as a person. <br><br><span

                <h2>What I have learned</h2>
                <p>
                    With the experience of website design, I have learned a lot of skills. <br>For example, when I first
                    learned HTML, I didn't know much about margin and padding, but after using them several times,
                    I have a better understanding of the timing of some tags. I also learned a lot about the
                    application of other tags. </p>
