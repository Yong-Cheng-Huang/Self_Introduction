            <h2>How did I feel on my first day of college? </h2>
            <p>
                The first day of college is always a mix of emotions. Excitement, nervousness, and a little bit of fear
                are all common feelings for new students. Personally, I remember feeling a combination of excitement and
                anxiety on my first day of college. I was excited to start this new chapter of my life, meet new people,
                and explore different academic interests. At the same time, I was nervous about adjusting to a new
                environment, managing a more demanding workload, and fitting in with my peers. Looking back, I realized
                that the first day of college is just the beginning of a long and rewarding journey, full of challenges
                and opportunities for growth.

            <h2>What are the differences between college and High school?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>College courses are more focused on independent learning, while high school courses tend to be more
                    structured and teacher-led.</li>
                <li>
                    College classes are often larger and more diverse, with students from a variety of backgrounds and
                    experiences.
                </li>
                <li>College offers more opportunities for exploration and self-discovery, from extracurricular
                    activities to study abroad programs, and encourages students to think critically about their goals
                    and values.</li>
