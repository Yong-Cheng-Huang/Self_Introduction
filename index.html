            <p class="content">As a introverted boy who is quite by nature, I likely find that I need more time alone to
                recharge my
                batteries.
                Because of my personality, I simply process information differently than extroverts, and I often need
                more
                time to think before I speak.
                One of the benefits of being an introvert is that I am often able to see
                things from a unique perspective.

                <p>In today's fast-paced world, it is essential to take some time off from our<br> busy lives and spend
                    quality time with our loved ones. Engaging in outdoor<br> activities is a great way to bond with
                    family
                    and friends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some activities that I enjoy doing with my family are biking and camping.
                    <br>Biking is not only a fun activity, but it is also a great way to stay active and<br> healthy. It
                    allows
                    us to explore new places and get some fresh air while we<br> are at it.
                    <br>Camping, on the other hand, is an excellent way to disconnect from the stresses <br>of everyday
                    life
                    and
                    connect with nature. It allows us to appreciate the simple<br> things in life and teaches us to be
                    self-sufficient.

                    One of the primary reasons why <br>people love watching videos on YouTube is its accessibility. With
                    just a few<br> clicks, you can access an endless supply of content from anywhere in the world.
                    <br>Usually, I watch online videos on YouTube 4~5 hours a day. <br>One of my favorite types of
                    videos is
                    traveling. I really enjoy the traveling video <br>because I can learn more about the world around
                    us,
                    such as cultures, <br>history, architecture, and so on.

            <h2>How did I feel on my first day of college? </h2>
            <p>
                The first day of college is always a mix of emotions. Excitement, nervousness, and a little bit of fear
                are all common feelings for new students. Personally, I remember feeling a combination of excitement and
                anxiety on my first day of college. I was excited to start this new chapter of my life, meet new people,
                and explore different academic interests. At the same time, I was nervous about adjusting to a new
                environment, managing a more demanding workload, and fitting in with my peers. Looking back, I realized
                that the first day of college is just the beginning of a long and rewarding journey, full of challenges
                and opportunities for growth.
            </p>
            <h2>What are the differences between college and High school?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>College courses are more focused on independent learning, while high school courses tend to be more
                    structured and teacher-led.</li>
                <li>
                    College classes are often larger and more diverse, with students from a variety of backgrounds and
                    experiences.
                </li>
                <li>College offers more opportunities for exploration and self-discovery, from extracurricular
                    activities to study abroad programs, and encourages students to think critically about their goals
                    and values.</li>

                    Welcome to my website! My name is Yong-Cheng Huang, and I am excited to share my passions and
                    experiences with you. <br>My website is a reflection of my personal and college experiences, and I
                    hope that it gives you a glimpse into who I am as a person. Totally, I spent about 1 week to design
                    my first website. <br><br><span style="color:rgba(78, 59, 23, 0.803);">Thank you for visiting, and I

                <p>
                    With the experience of website design, I have learned a lot of skills about HTML. <br>For example,
                    when I first
                    learned it, I didn't know much about margin and padding, but after using them several times,
                    I have a better understanding of the timing of some tags. I also learned a lot about the
                    application of other tags.<br><br> </p>
